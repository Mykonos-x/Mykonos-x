I'm an amateur binary security researcher, or you could say, a hobbyist in cybersecurity. I dabble in all sorts of things in my spare time, but I'm not a master at any of them. I'm trying to make my mundane life a bit more exciting by creating something out of the ordinary. Who knows what the future holds? For now, let's just enjoy the present.
